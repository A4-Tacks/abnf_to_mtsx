This is a conversion software,
that inserts the abnf format into the mtsx syntax file for easy writing.

The mtsx format is a syntax highlighting rule file
in the text editor that comes with [MT-Manager].

There is an example file [example.mtsx],
that can help you quickly learn how to use this tool

## NOTE
Due to the fact that the editor highlighting of [MT-Manager] is not a Parser,
it is not possible to perform syntax derivation well. Please use it carefully.

Due to the fact that using a large number of redundant matchers for failure
deduction is not the main style highlighted in the [MT-Manager] editor,
and there are performance issues, attention should be paid when using it.
